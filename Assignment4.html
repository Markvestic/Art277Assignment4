    <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
    <p>
        When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. I started after my grandparents first brought me to their home
        in France and I have now been to twenty-nine differnt countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.
        <p>
            At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight,
            I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided
            down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient,
            megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the 
            thousand-year-old stones were still in place.

            It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became intersted in Language.<br/>

            <p>It began with French, which taugh me the importance
            of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue
            des Pyramidex was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more
            accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
            <p>In the eight grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its 
                similarties with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is
                beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible 
                to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find 
                that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

                <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied
                    Chinese at my School, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a 
                    character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by 
                    combining simpler character, so Huǒ (火) meaning  fire Shān (山) and Shān (山)  meaning 
                    mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcan. I love 
                    spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
                    and rhythm as I form them.
